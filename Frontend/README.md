# GraphqlFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

## To setup Apollo Angular

Apollo Angular is the ultra-flexible, community driven GraphQL client for Angular, JavaScript, and native platforms. It is designed from the ground up to make it easy to build UI components that fetch data with GraphQL.

1. Run 'ng add apollo-angular' and provide backend uri when asked
2. Install some packages - 'npm i apollo-angular @apollo/client graphql'
3. After all this, we can create our query in our services and send the request to backend using apollo.
4. You can also add GraphQL Network extension toour browser such as Chrome where we can check all the graphQL network calls.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
